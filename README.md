<h1>ntem-api</h1>
ntem-api is a Node.js library designed to help you build a simple RESTful API. This library uses the Express.js framework to handle HTTP requests and the MongoDB database driver to perform database operations.

<h1>Installation</h1>
To use ntem-api, you will first need a Node.js environment. Then, you can add the ntem-api package to your project using the following command:
<code>npm install ntem-api
</code>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
To start using ntem-api, you will first need to create an Express.js application. Then, add ntem-api to your project and initialize the application object with an instance of Ntem. For example:

<code>
const express = require('express');
const { Ntem } = require('ntem-api');

const app = express();
const ntem = new Ntem();

// Ntem middleware
app.use(ntem.middleware());

// Start the application server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Application started on port 3000');
});

</code>

This is the basic structure needed to use ntem-api within an Express.js application.

<h1>Routing</h1>
ntem-api uses routing to handle HTTP requests. Routing maps requests to specific URL patterns. Based on the request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), ntem-api routes the request to a corresponding method on the Ntem object.

Here's an example of how to create a route for a GET request:

<code>
ntem.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  const users = await ntem.db.collection('users').find().toArray();
  res.json(users);
});
</code>


In this example, we define a route for a GET request to /users. When this request is received, ntem-api retrieves all documents from the users collection in the database and returns them as a JSON response.


<hr>

<h1>Error Handling</h1>

ntem-api provides error handling middleware to catch any errors that occur during request processing. You can use the errorHandler method to register this middleware in your Express.js application:

<code> app.use(ntem.errorHandler());
</code>

This middleware will catch any errors that occur in your routes or other middleware and return an appropriate error response.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
ntem-api provides a simple way to build a RESTful API using Node.js and MongoDB. With its intuitive routing and error handling middleware, you can quickly build a reliable API for your application.
